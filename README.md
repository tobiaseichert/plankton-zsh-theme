# plankton.zsh-theme

A simple no-frills ZSH theme.

The theme has been tested on MacOS using the "SF Mono" font. If you would like to adopt the colors used in the screenshot, simply add the following export to your .zshrc:

```zsh
export LSCOLORS=Exfxcxdxbxdxdxabagacad
```

This setup works really well with the [Nord Terminal.app color theme](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-terminal-app).
